## Packages

During my free & professional time, I like to play with R, HTML, CSS, and Javascript to construct R shiny packages that facilitate the design of apps ready for production (and maximize time for Data Science & Research).

```{r}
#| echo: false

library(bslib)
library(shiny)
card_modif <- function(img,href,title,body){
  div(class = "g-col-12 g-col-md-6",
      #div(class="cell h-100",
          # div(class = "cell-output-display",
          #     style = "height:100% !important",
  div(class="card h-100",
        tags$img(
          src=img,
          class="card-img-top mx-auto mt-2",
          style = "width:33%",
          alt="..."
        ),
        div(class = "card-body",
            h5(class="card-title",title),
            div(class="fs-6 lead text-muted",body),
                ),
      div(
              class="card-footer bg-white text-center",
              tags$a(
                href="posts.qmd",
                class="card-link second-color-link heading-font",
                "Github"
              ))
              
              
            )
            )

}

```


```{r}
#| echo: false

    div(class="grid",
card_modif(
        img = "image/shinyrating.png",
        href = "https://github.com/rstudio/shiny",
        title = "ShinyRating",
        body = "ShinyRating is an R package that allow to create rating inputs in Shiny. Optimized for Bootstrap 5 "
        ),

        title = "ShinyFriendlyCaptcha",
        body = "ShinyFriendlyCaptcha is a R package that provide a GDPR compliant Captcha  to Shiny apps ((Friendly Captcha). Friendly Captcha is an European alternative to Google Recaptcha. It allow to protect websites against spam and bots in a privacy-embedded design."
        )#,

#         img = "",
#         href = "https://github.com/rstudio/shiny",
#         title = "ShinyLemonPie",
